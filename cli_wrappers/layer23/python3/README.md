# Python3 Example
The files in this directory uses Python3 as the scripting language
for controlling Xena's L2-3 products: XenaCompact and XenaBay.

The files comprise a small Python3 library named `testutils` and some 
test scripts using the functionality provided by the library.

In the following examples we assume that your chassis ip address is `192.168.1.200`
and uses ports `0/0` and `0/1` of that chassis. Change the script arguments for
your particular setup.
