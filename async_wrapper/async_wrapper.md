# XOA Script Documentation - Wrapper of Async Functions

The APIs provided by xoa-driver are **async** functions. This means any function that uses the xoa-driver must be declared as **async**. This might be a problem for you if your existing framework doesn't support async functions. To solve this "incompatibility" issue, we have made an async wrapper class **XenaAsyncWrapper** for you to wrap xoa-driver's async function inside and use it as a regular Python function.
